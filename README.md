# MultiMode_LFSR_deEncryptor
## Introduction
Hey! I was doing some amateur research how can i just simply encode my data. I wanted to know how encryption works, and be able to write it by myself.
Because of simplicity, I chosen an Linear Feedback Shift Register.

## OKkk... How it works??

Linear Feedback Shift Register is just a bunch of bits - in order from the MSB(n-st from right) to LSB(1st from right). It can have 1 Byte(8 bits), 2 Bytes(16 bits), 3 Bytes(24 bits), or MOAR! if u think you need more privacy idk...

The initial value of bits is a seed value. It's just an encryption key.

To generate next Byte, you have to perform:

* Generate a new bit, from the feedback of actual bits(you build a state machine!)
* Shift data by 1 bit to left
* In the blank bit place from the right side You have to place the previously generated bit

You repeat this process the same times like bit ammount in your seed value.
To generate next Byte you repeat the process, but now as seed you use previously generated Byte value.

In order to encrypt the data which are 'x' Bytes long, you have to generate the same length Pseudorandom table from the LFSR.
To encrypt, just XOR the original data bits with Pseudorandom table - the output table is encrypted data. To decrypt You have to XOR encrypted data with a Pseudorandom table which was used to encrypt.
